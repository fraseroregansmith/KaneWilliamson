### About my project 

My Project is about New Zealand cricket superstar and captain, Kane Williamson. The Website has 4 Main pages. The Main page, ( index ) which is a bit of bio and information about Kane. There is also a button you can click to translate in into Te reo Māori.  The Images page includes images of kane, and then underneath a bit of information about them. Then there is the stats page, which includes all his careen stats and his noticeable achievements. Kane Williamson is one of my favourite cricket players and very likely the greatest New Zealand has ever seen, so that is why I chose him for this project.

### My design progress

* Layout
     * Layout is designed for easy and quick use, and no confusion about what is happening by simple navigation
* Colour
     * I Chose the bright green background and the bright header colours to make them stand out and be bright
* Font (s)
     * I used default font because I really dont like all the weird fancy ones, my eyes dont like them much. Its just a lot smoother to read the plain font, and with some of the fancy fonts you actually have to look closely what the letter actually is!
* Navigation 
     * Designed for easy Nav
* Image choices
     * My image choices were designed to sum up Kane effectively in as little images as possible, and highlight some of the main things about him and his cricket 




My Website works the same on Google, Firefox and Microsoft edge. 
* Screenshots of all my pages are found on this doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BGrhp_k9nQ0Rr3ekMzL2tIZZ_Tiz-2ge85RutUMhTz0/edit

* What did I struggle with on making the website?
    * I found it annoying making the Māori pages, because after every edit I did on the english page, I had to put it back into the translator each time. Also super annoying because the google translate to Māori is not the best.

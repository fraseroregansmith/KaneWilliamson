### About my project 

My Project is about New Zealand cricket superstar and captain, Kane Williamson. The Website has 4 Main pages. The Main page, ( index ) which is a bit of bio and information about kane. There is also a button you can click to translate in into Te reo MƒÅori.  The Images page includes images of kane, and then underneath a bit of information about them.

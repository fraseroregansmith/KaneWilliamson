### About my project 

My Project is about New Zealand cricket superstar and captain, Kane Williamson. The Website has 4 Main pages. The Main page, ( index ) which is a bit of bio and information about kane. There is also a button you can click to translate in into Te reo MƒÅori.  The Images page includes images of kane, and then underneath a bit of information about them. Then there is the stats page, which includes all his careen stats and his noticeable achievements. Kane Williamson is one of my favourite cricket players and very likely the greatest New Zealand has ever seen, so that is why I chose him for this project.

### My design progress

* Layout
     * Layout is designed for easy and quick use, and no confusion about what is happening by simple navigation
* Colour
     * I Chose the bright green background and the bright header colours to make them stand out and be brigt 
* Font (s)
     * I used default font because I really dont like all the weird fancy ones, my eyes dont like them much
* Navigation 
     * Designed for easy Nav
* Image choices
     * My image choices were designed to sum up Kane effectively in as little images as possible.
